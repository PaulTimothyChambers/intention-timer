## Wins

* Deepened grasp of CSS and HTML fundamentals

## Challenges + Improvements

* Due to unforeseen circumstances, very little refactoring was performed. Code is functional, but extremely sloppy. Wish I had two more days to make it DRY and readable. Git workflow was also impacted severely by circumstances.
